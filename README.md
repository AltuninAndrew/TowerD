# TowerD
Representative of the classic tower defence.

# Essence of game
Protect the main artifact of the village-the egg from the creepy skeletons, installing towers with different characteristics on special plates. The budget is limited, each tower has a limited number of bullets that need to be reloaded. Fight off a few waves to win.

# Code architecture
The architecture is based on the interaction of controllers. Each controller is represented by an object behavior component.
In addition to the main controllers, there are components that define additional features of objects.

# importantly
The current development is completely raw, it lacks a lot of planned features and competent game design. It is also worth noting that the optimization at the moment leaves much to be desired.
